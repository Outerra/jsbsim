/** Encapsulates a filter for the flight control system.
The filter component can simulate any first or second order filter. The
Tustin substitution is used to take filter definitions from LaPlace space to the
time domain. The general format for a filter specification is:

@code
<typename name="name">
  <input> property </input>
  <c1> value|property </c1>
  [<c2> value|property </c2>]
  [<c3> value|property </c3>]
  [<c4> value|property </c4>]
  [<c5> value|property </c5>]
  [<c6> value|property </c6>]
  [<clipto>
    <min> {[-]property name | value} </min>
    <max> {[-]property name | value} </max>
  </clipto>]
  [<output> property </output>]
</typename>
@endcode

For a lag filter of the form,

@code
  C1
------
s + C1
@endcode

the corresponding filter definition is:

@code
<lag_filter name="name">
  <input> property </input>
  <c1> value|property </c1>
  [<clipto>
    <min> {[-]property name | value} </min>
    <max> {[-]property name | value} </max>
  </clipto>]
  [<output> property <output>]
</lag_filter>
@endcode

As an example, for the specific filter:

@code
  600
------
s + 600
@endcode

the corresponding filter definition could be:

@code
<lag_filter name="Heading Roll Error Lag">
  <input> fcs/heading-command </input>
  <c1> 600 </c1>
</lag_filter>
@endcode

For a lead-lag filter of the form:

@code
C1*s + C2
---------
C3*s + C4
@endcode

The corresponding filter definition is:

@code
<lead_lag_filter name="name">
  <input> property </input>
  <c1> value|property <c/1>
  <c2> value|property <c/2>
  <c3> value|property <c/3>
  <c4> value|property <c/4>
  [<clipto>
    <min> {[-]property name | value} </min>
    <max> {[-]property name | value} </max>
  </clipto>]
  [<output> property </output>]
</lead_lag_filter>
@endcode

For a washout filter of the form:

@code
  s
------
s + C1
@endcode

The corresponding filter definition is:

@code
<washout_filter name="name">
  <input> property </input>
  <c1> value </c1>
  [<clipto>
    <min> {[-]property name | value} </min>
    <max> {[-]property name | value} </max>
  </clipto>]
  [<output> property </output>]
</washout_filter>
@endcode

For a second order filter of the form:

@code
C1*s^2 + C2*s + C3
------------------
C4*s^2 + C5*s + C6
@endcode

The corresponding filter definition is:

@code
<second_order_filter name="name">
  <input> property </input>
  <c1> value|property </c1>
  <c2> value|property </c2>
  <c3> value|property </c3>
  <c4> value|property </c4>
  <c5> value|property </c5>
  <c6> value|property </c6>
  [<clipto>
    <min> {[-]property name | value} </min>
    <max> {[-]property name | value} </max>
  </clipto>]
  [<output> property </output>]
</second_order_filter>
@endcode

For an integrator of the form:

@code
 C1
 ---
  s
@endcode

The corresponding filter definition is:

@code
<integrator name="name">
  <input> property </input>
  <c1> value|property </c1>
  [<trigger> property </trigger>]
  [<clipto>
    <min> {[-]property name | value} </min>
    <max> {[-]property name | value} </max>
  </clipto>]
  [<output> property </output>]
</integrator>
@endcode

For the integrator, the trigger features the following behavior. If the trigger
property value is:
  - 0: no action is taken - the output is calculated normally
  - not 0: (or simply greater than zero), all current and previous inputs will
           be set to 0.0

In all the filter specifications above, an \<output> element is also seen.  This
is so that the last component in a "string" can copy its value to the appropriate
output, such as the elevator, or speedbrake, etc.
