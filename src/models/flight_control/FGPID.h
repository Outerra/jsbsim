/** Encapsulates a PID control component for the flight control system.

<h3>Configuration Format:</h3>

@code
<pid name="{string}" [type="standard"]>
  <kp> {number|property} </kp>
  <ki> {number|property} </ki>
  <kd> {number|property} </kd>
  <trigger> {property} </trigger>
</pid>
@endcode

For the integration constant element, one can also supply the type attribute for
what kind of integrator to be used, one of:

- rect, for a rectangular integrator
- trap, for a trapezoidal integrator
- ab2, for a second order Adams Bashforth integrator
- ab3, for a third order Adams Bashforth integrator

For example,

@code
<pid name="fcs/heading-control">
  <kp> 3 </kp>
  <ki type="ab3"> 1 </ki>
  <kd> 1 </kd>
</pid>
@endcode



<h3>Configuration Parameters:</h3>
<pre>

  The values of kp, ki, and kd have slightly different interpretations depending on
  whether the PID controller is a standard one, or an ideal/parallel one - with the latter
  being the default.
  
  kp      - Proportional constant, default value 0.
  ki      - Integrative constant, default value 0.
  kd      - Derivative constant, default value 0.
  trigger - Property which is used to sense wind-up, optional. Most often, the trigger
            will be driven by the "saturated" property of a particular actuator. When
            the relevant actuator has reached it's limits (if there are any, specified
            by the <clipto> element) the automatically generated saturated property will
            be greater than zero (true). If this property is used as the trigger for the
            integrator, the integrator will not continue to integrate while the property
            is still true (> 1), preventing wind-up.
  pvdot   - The property to be used as the process variable time derivative.
