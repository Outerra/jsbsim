<h3>Configuration Parameters:</h3>
<pre>
    \<ixx>           - Propeller rotational inertia.
    \<diameter>      - Propeller disk diameter.
    \<numblades>     - Number of blades.
    \<gearratio>     - Ratio of (engine rpm) / (prop rpm).
    \<minpitch>      - Minimum blade pitch angle.
    \<maxpitch>      - Maximum blade pitch angle.
    \<minrpm>        - Minimum rpm target for constant speed propeller.
    \<maxrpm>        - Maximum rpm target for constant speed propeller.
    \<constspeed>    - 1 = constant speed mode, 0 = manual pitch mode. 
    \<reversepitch>  - Blade pitch angle for reverse.
    \<sense>         - Direction of rotation (1=clockwise as viewed from cockpit,
                        -1=anti-clockwise as viewed from cockpit). Sense is
                       specified in the parent tag of the propeller.
    \<p_factor>      - P factor.
    \<ct_factor>     - A multiplier for the coefficients of thrust.
    \<cp_factor>     - A multiplier for the coefficients of power.
</pre>

    Two tables are needed. One for coefficient of thrust (Ct) and one for
    coefficient of power (Cp).

    Two tables are optional. They apply a factor to Ct and Cp based on the
    helical tip Mach.
