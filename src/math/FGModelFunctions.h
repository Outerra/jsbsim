CLASS DOCUMENTATION

/** The model functions class provides the capability for loading, storing, and
    executing arbitrary functions.
    For certain classes, such as the engine, aerodynamics, ground reactions, 
    mass balance, etc., it can be useful to incorporate special functions that
    can operate on the local model parameters before and/or after the model
    executes. For example, there is no inherent chamber pressure calculation
    done in the rocket engine model. However, an arbitrary function can be added
    to a specific rocket engine XML configuration file. It would be tagged with
    a "pre" or "post" type attribute to denote whether the function is to be
    executed before or after the standard model algorithm.
